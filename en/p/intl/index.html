<h2 class="ui dividing header">Introduction</h2>

<h3 class="ui header">
Our project goal
</h3>

<p>
Taiwan's open source and open culture communities are quite vibrant. When facing international communities, they can not only actively engage but also have the capability to collaborate on substantial projects together. The Open Culture Foundation hopes to serve as a connecting channel, linking more Taiwanese open source contributors to step onto the international stage, while also fostering closer and deeper exchanges between Taiwan's open culture projects, experiences, and achievements with international communities. Especially when channels between international and local communities have yet to be established, the Open Culture Foundation can assist in connecting relevant communities and, in the early stages, act as a fixed contact point for international partners, supporting the development of an international network for these communities.<p>
<p>
This year, we look forward to facilitating more tangible collaborations between Taiwanese communities and international groups, jointly developing shared projects. Additionally, we aim to encourage cross-disciplinary collaboration between tech and cybersecurity experts and social and human rights environmental workers, enabling the tech network of open culture to grow stronger with robust mutual support.
