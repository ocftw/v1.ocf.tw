<h2 class="ui dividing header">Project</h2>
<p>
  Open Culture Foundation (<a href="https://ocf.tw/">OCF</a>), as a <a href="https://ooni.org/partners/open-culture-foundation/">partner</a> of the OONI community, supports censorship measurement from a local perspective and shares internet censorship findings with the public.
</p>

<h3 class="ui dividing header">Apps</h3>
<p>The OONI project primarily observes whether the network it is located in delivers unexpected browsing content to the end-user through intervention. It provides real-time and publicly available analysis of network censorship observation data.</p>

    <div class="header">Internet Tampering</div>
    <p>The detection of network intervention situations may occur through the following, but is not limited to, conditions:</p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>DNS tampering (DNS anomaly)</li>
      <li>IP blocking (TCP/IP anomaly)</li>
      <li>HTTP blocking (e.g block page)</li>
      <li>
      TLS based interference (e.g connection reset observed right after the
      ClientHello message during the TLS handshake)
      </li>

    <div class="header">What is an autonomous system? | What are ASNs?</div>
    <p>The Internet is a network of networks*, and autonomous systems are the big networks that make up the Internet. More specifically, an autonomous system (AS) is a large network or group of networks that has a unified routing policy. Every computer or device that connects to the Internet is connected to an AS.

    <div class="header">Test Lists</div>
    <p>During the 'Web Connectivity' test phase, OONI utilizes lists maintained by The Citizen Lab globally and regionally. However, the list for TW (Taiwan) was last updated in 2017, and many websites have since shut down or changed their URLs, requiring organization and review.</p>
