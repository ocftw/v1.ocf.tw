<h3 class="ui header">About Open Culture Foundation (OCF)</h3> 
<P><blockquote>(The) Open Culture Foundation is a non-profit organization. Through promoting open technology and cross-field collaboration, we continue to connect tech communities and other public and private entities in Taiwan. By doing so, we work to promote open co-creation and protect digital rights, and thereby support a more transparent and inclusive digital civil society.</blockquote></p>

<P><blockquote>Since 2014, we have functioned as a legal entity and supported over 30 open technology communities in Taiwan. Throughout this process, we have not only continued to promote the idea of open technology, we have also become involved in policy advocacy and spoken up for the public's digital rights. Through this process, we have created a base for the development of open technology in Taiwan. None of these successes are the result of OCF alone. Rather, they are the result of several open tech communities, individuals and organizations working together to make Taiwan's internet and digital environment more open, transparent, and participation.<blockquote> </p>

<P><blockquote>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Open Source:</strong>&nbsp;Open source: The operation of technology is open, transparency and participation. Through the openness and collaboration, everyone can use and improve technology. By doing this, it highly increase the public trust and the privacy protection. Meanwhile, as the software development is not enclosed anymore, everyone can promote and contribute to civilization development and technology innovation.
<li> <strong>Open Data:</strong>&nbsp;Implementing open data, through using open source licenses to release data directly or indirectly collected by major public and private fields, we can make different data connectable and thus enable greater knowledge sharing and public information.
<li> <strong>Open Government:</strong>&nbsp;Using digital technology to help the government use open and collaborative means to promote digital governance and thereby create new potentials for public participation. 
<li> <strong>Internet Freedom:</strong>&nbsp;The internet should not create divisions and should instead be universal. The internet should ensure our freedom of speech and freedom of assembly, and through ensuring the internet has an open base, find a balance between the public good and private profit. 
<li> <strong>Digital Rights:</strong>&nbsp;The concept of “digital rights” has two meanings, firstly, our existing human rights (such as the right to privacy) need to exist online, and secondly, new types of rights (such as the right to internet access) that have emerged as digital technologies have become more common, must also be protected.

<h3 class="ui header">What is Our Culture :Open Culture</h3>
<h4 class="ui header">Open, Transparent, participation</h4>
</div>

<P><blockquote>The Open Culture Foundation was founded to promote Taiwan’s open source communities. The hope was that by encouraging open and shareable source code, we could help to create a trend wherein everyone can modify, contribute and co-work to improve technology collectively. Following the digitalization of society as a whole, this line of thought has continued to extend beyond just coding and now includes all types of social behaviors and systems. We believe that openness can ensure that knowledge and technology will no longer be monopolized by a small number of technical experts of private enterprises. Through openness, we can promote quick growth and sustainable recording of this progress, and it is only through an open culture of this kind that we can exert a positive influence on society in the digital era.</blockquote></p> 

<P><blockquote>Building on the spirit of openness and incorporating digital rights and internet freedom, our style is  “Open, transparent, participation. When we make decisions relating to making plans or taking action, we consider the (non-exhaustive) list of principles listed below. </blockquote></p>
  
<P><blockquote>  
<ul>
<li> Rough Consensus and Running Code: As soon as a rough consensus is reached, we encourage people to try things out and not criticize errors.
<li> Patches Welcome：When feedback is needed, we provide concrete and actionable advice
<li> Release early, Release often: all drafts or models prototypes developed during all work processes  should be released early and often  
<li> Open information: As long there are no privacy concerns and there is enough manpower to handle the task, all information should be released openly 
<li> Sharing experience: the results of all our projects should be released openly, and in addition, all experience and knowledge gained throughout the process should also be shared with the outside world 
<li> Implementing openness in our daily lives: within reasonable means, we try to use open source technology and services and avoid monopolization by corporate software 
<li> Respecting diversity: we respect and protect the independence and autonomy of the communities we support  
</ul>
