og_title: Open Technology and Advocacy 
og_description: Open Technology is inspired by the collaborative sharing culture within the tech community and the spirit of equal participation in civil society. The idea includes three dimensions: open source, open data, and open government. By considering societal context and the interests of various stakeholders in the process of technology development and solution-building, we seek to minimize the social costs associated with addressing the impacts of emerging technologies.

<h2 class="ui dividing header">About Open Technology</h2>
<p>Open Technology comprises Open Source, Open Data and Open Government. The goal of open technology is to ensure that the construction of our digital society, the collection of data and the functioning of government is all open, transparent and participation. By ensuring these principles, open technology aims to promote the implementation of digital rights and internet freedom, thus allowing for the realization of a digital civic society.

<h2 class="ui dividing header">Three Open and OCF Initiatives</h2>
<h3 class="ui dividing header">Open Source – A Technological Solution with Public Participation</h3>
<p>Open source code can promote product development and rapid industrial advancement. It is also the foundation of the digital age and the basis for promoting Internet freedom and digital human rights. Only when the production methods of source code and technology are more diversified and free from monopoly, can people participate in it and create a digital society that is fair, free and protects the rights and interests of users. Therefore, the concept of "open source" should not be limited to the open source code of software and hardware itself, but also the attitude and behavioral values that should be faced in the face of technological evolution. Our three main objectives for open source：</p>

<ol>
  <li>Improve the Open Source Software Ecosystem</li>
  <li>Urge the Government’s Implementation of Public Money, Public Code (PMPC)  to Achieve Open Technologies</li>
  <li>Encourages All Parties to Obtain<a href="https://www.openchainproject.org/"> OpenChain </a>Certification to Reduce Legal Risks</li>

</ul>

<h3 class="ui dividing header">Open Data – The Cornerstone for Digital Transformation</h3>
<p>The rapid development of the digital environment, the application of digital and Internet in daily life and government systems, has increased the possibility for "individuals" to participate in public decision-making, and "open data" is the cornerstone of realizing this ideal. Only by building open data can we truly achieve the goal of public participation and supervision and increase the transparency of government governance. The purpose of open data puts more emphasis on improving people's well-being rather than value-added applications at the economic level. The directions for continuing to promote open data are as follows：</p>

<ol>
  <li>Legalizing the openness of government information</li>
  <li>Open data accessible to the people, value-added thinking for the people’s use</a></li>
</ol>

<h3 class="ui dividing header">Open Government – Build a Government with Transparency, Efficiency, Public-Private Partnership and Accountability</h3>
<p>OCF has been actively promoting open government since 2016. We assembled a non-government delegation to attend the Open Government Partner Global Summit throughout the years, and published the first non-governmental Taiwan Open Government Report (en) in 2017. With the Executive Yuan and Legislative Yuan deciding to adopt the OGP principles to formulate their own action plans in 2020, OCF was involved in the preparation and discussion of these action plans. Not only was OCF named a member of the first Open Government Committee, it also worked with the Executive Yuan to organize open government-related training and forums targeting the private sector, the general public and the international community. We will continue to promote open government and combine our initiatives with open technologies to promote open government data/information from both legal and international initiative perspectives. We will also increase the public’s knowledge and awareness about public-private partnership and open government.</p>
<p>In 2024, the second National Action Plan for Open Government began and called for proposals. OCF has accordingly submitted proposals based on the following directions: we connect and integrate our open source, open data and open government initiatives, focusing on the shortcomings of the government's open data system and establishing better citizen participation in open data and decision-making mechanisms. Our future promotion directions are as follows：</p>
<ol>
  <li>Promote the promulgation of a special open data law and improve the data governance and application environment in Taiwan</li>
  <li>With the government promoting an open government action plan in compliance with the OGP principles, continue to encourage both the government and civic organizations to participate in open government affairs with the planning and execution of the commitments.</a></li>
