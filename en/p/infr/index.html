<h2 class="ui dividing header">Pursuing true online freedom of expression begins with caring about the issues around us.</h2>
<p>Internet freedom has become an issue of growing concern for international organizations. As authoritarian governments and politicians around the world continuously employ surveillance equipment, spyware, and disinformation in an attempt to confuse the public’s online information sources, our personal privacy data may be leaking from government agencies and e-commerce platforms and circulating online worldwide. The security of internet equipment, the neutrality of telecom operators, the data management responsibilities of platforms, and the legal policies of relevant government agencies are all critical issues related to internet freedom today.</p>
<p>Through promotion, advocacy, and other means, we call for the internet to be built on a foundation of open technology—striving for freedom of expression, freedom from surveillance and censorship, and technological neutrality.</p>
<p>If you also care about internet freedom, please join our online forum and monthly meetup events.</p>
