  <p>President Lai Ching-te and Taiwan Government,</p>
  <p>
    At the beginning of 2025, amidst the dramatic international turmoil, the
    rapid development of emerging technologies, and domestic political changes,
    we firmly believe that the Taiwan government will continue to move towards
    digital human rights and the rule of law in the face of challenges, as
    President Lai Ching-te has himself committed to the "New Digital Society"
    promises at the beginning of his term.
  </p>    
  <p>As a partner of the 15th <a href="https://rightscon.org">RightsCon</a>, the
    Taiwan government also embraces the themes that the conference believes in:
    digital governance, democracy, and human rights. Civil society
    organizations, as representatives of the people monitoring governmental
    power, respectfully call on you to take the following important measures and
    carefully consider the following issues related to digital governance and
    human rights:

        </p>
        <div>
          <p>
            It is high time to establish practical legal mechanisms regarding
            digital rights and freedoms to ensure democracy and rule of law
            continues to strive in the digital age. We urge your attention on
            the “Digital Bill of Rights” drafted by civil society, which focuses
            on the individual and the people’s rights, government obligations
            and constraint of power, as well as establishing the due process and
            remedy mechanism for when the individual and the people’s rights are
            to be restricted by the government.
          </p>
          <p>
            The government should establish digital rights including, but not
            limited to, the public and the individual’s right to be informed, as
            an extension of the right to digital autonomy (including the ability
            to be fully aware and control the utilization of personal and
            behavioral data and footprints), the right to secrecy, the right to
            anonymity, the right to request
            non-digital/non-personal/non-automatic decision-making, and the
            right to meaningful alternatives,etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            We urge your attention on the “Digital Bill of Rights,” by which a
            bottom-up approach is taken up by volunteering lawyers, tech
            experts, and human rights activists.

              assuring data protection authority’s power and duties. We request

            <li>
              Ensure the independent agency protecting personal data has

          well as standard operating procedures and a stringent timeline to

          incident in 2022 where over 23 million people’s household registration
          data were leaked, the government should immediately prevent further
          damage, implement substantive remedial plans, complete an independent
          investigation into the leak, and officially report the full details of
          the incident and the corresponding remedial plan to the public.</p>

            When interfering with online content (such as requiring taking down

            itself under the principle of legal reservation and ensure the

            the government to periodically publish statistics on internet
            content and access limitation demands.

          <p>
            Public authorities have a duty to ensure the neutrality and openness
            of the internet. When intervening in internet content (such as
            requesting the removal or blocking of websites), it must be based on
            clear legal authorization and in accordance with the principle of
            proportionality. Additionally, an independent oversight and remedy
            mechanism should be established. The government's enforcement
            process should also be transparent and fully documented, with
            regular publication of statistics on requests to restrict internet
            content or access.

            The government should promote and adopt legislation for digital

            responsibilities and obligations for digital service providers.
            Especially for internet platform providers above a certain scale,
            the government should establish human rights governing mechanisms
            that can handle third-party accountability and remedy for rights
            violations, to prevent various human rights violations and negative

          </p>

            Both Government and enterprises should actively promote a network
            environment favorable for mental health, internet privacy, and

            includes, but is not limited to, preventing cyberbullying, child and

            Additionally, the government should require enterprises to adopt

        <div><p>
          Promote the development of open-source (open source code, open data,
          and open government), information commons and civic technology to
          advance the transparency, monitorability, and tenacity of public
          service and digital development. Particularly, free and open-source
          software (FLOSS) can advance sustainability, local innovation, and
          civic empowerment in digital development. The government should
          formulate policies and laws that include open source as the core
          strategy for public service and digital development.</p>

    Your commitment and determination to address the issues above will
    contribute to making Taiwan a model for digital human rights for the region
    and beyond. We look forward to discussing these issues with you and sharing
    the legal and technical expertise in paving the way to Taiwan’s digital
    governance, democracy and human rights.

    specific policies, amend laws, and incorporate them into the coming National
    Human Rights Action Plan.
