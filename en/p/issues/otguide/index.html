<p>This guideline consists of four chapters. Chapter 1 - 3 introduce three vital aspects of open technology: "Open Source", "Open Data", and "Open Government". Each chapter covers the definition, historical background, current practices in Taiwan, recommendations from the Open Culture Foundation (OCF), as well as frequently asked questions and answers. The fourth chapter provides a comprehensive discussion on the concept of "openness", with a particular focus on the relationship between open technology and public participation, the implementation of openness, and most importantly, why we believe the society needs “openness”.
