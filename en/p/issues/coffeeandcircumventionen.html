<p> This is a monthly meetup which focuses on talking about internet freedom!</p>
​
<div class="ui list">
	<div class="header"> <Why do we host these meetings?> </div>
  <p> The idea of the meetup came from the Internet Freedom Festival (IFF), one of the largest digital rights communities in the world. It gathers hackers from all over the world to defend activists oin the frontline. OCF was invited by IFF to initiate “Coffee & Circumvention” (C&C) in Taiwan. The C&C meetup was planned to be hosted in many cities across in the world by local groups to discuss the issues regarding internet freedom and digital rights on every 3rd Thursday in the month. The meetup now is localized in Taiwan and called ”Internet Freedom Meetup", or "網路自由小聚“  </p>
​  <p> The first Internet Freedom Meetup was held in September. 2019 by OCF and partners from Mozilla TW, COSCUP (conference for open source), and CSCS (Cyber Shield Civil Society). </p> 
  <p> In the beginning, we weren't sure if this Meetup would be popular because not many people talked about internet freedom in Taiwan at that time, even within technology communities. However, surprisingly, people regularly attended the meetup and we always have new comers. Now, the meetup has a growing organizers’ group, several attendees volunteered to be the organizers and bring their ideas and knowledge into the meetup.   </p>
  <p> Because our internet is more open, less monitored, and has less control and threats than in many other part of the world, a lot of us in Taiwan might not feel very engaged with the concept of internet freedom, and thus many aren’t aware of the urgency of standing up for and defending internet freedom internationally. In the digital age, everything written online travels beyond borders, and everyone needs to be aware of their digital rights. So let’s get together and chat and get to understand important aspects of global internet freedom</p>
