        description: "After ten years, OCF continues to evolve while staying true to its original mission. We remain dedicated to helping open-source communities grow by supporting emerging communities and sustaining long-established ones. Over the years, we have witnessed Taiwan's open-source ecosystem flourish.
        <br>This year, we explored more cross-sector collaborations by organizing the ”Open Source Festival,“ where we reflected on the history and the progress of open source in Taiwan. Also, we built connections with the arts and music communities to bring fresh energy to open-source culture.
<br>The past decade has brought many changes. The COVID-19 pandemic made online events the norm. Open-source communities have faced challenges in leadership transition and sustainability. Rapid technological advancements have also raised concerns about human rights and privacy. In response, we have never stopped exploring new ways to collaborate with communities and develop effective partnership models.
<br>In 2024, we focused on five core areas. We gained a deeper understanding of the open-source ecosystem and its challenges through research and active engagement with stakeholders. We aim to build an inclusive, diverse, and open digital environment.
<br>We also took action by proposing initiatives to the government and training public officials, embedding the DNA of open collaboration into public-private partnerships. While strengthening the collaboration infrastructure between citizens, the government, and parliament, we also monitored the implementation of digital rights policies to ensure that technology remains open and inclusive. Technology should make our lives more convenient and protect our privacy and human rights simultaneously.
<br>To better advocate for open-source culture, we integrated open government, open data, and open-source software under a unified “Open Technology” initiative. We organized various promotional activities locally while strengthening our connections with international communities. Through the Open Source Festival, we sparked interdisciplinary collaboration by expanding open-source culture into the humanities and arts fields.
<br>By staying true to our mission while adapting to the times, we can create even more possibilities in the next decade. Thank you to all our supporters—let's continue working together for the future of open culture!

        description: "<h3>Support Community</h3>Managing finances, maintaining fundraising pages, and handling administrative tasks for open-source communities have always been a core mission of OCF. Ensuring smooth operations enables communities to focus on their growth and sustainability.
<br>Based on this foundation, we continuously explored new ways to support community longevity and development. Through CONCOM (CONference for open COMmunities), we engaged with over 30 open-source communities to discuss key topics such as attracting new members, organizing online events, and refining inclusive Codes of Conduct.
<br>Additionally, OCF facilitated eVisa applications for nearly 300 international participants of WordCamp Asia 2024, ensuring the seamless execution of this 1,000+ attendee international conference—a testament to our strong coordination capabilities.
<br><h3>Cultivate Talent</h3>A thriving open-source ecosystem relies on a diverse pool of contributors. In 2024, OCF trained 15 interns, providing them with hands-on experience working with open-source communities or within OCF itself, allowing them to explore community and NGO work environments. Additionally, we cultivated 2 skilled translators who specialized in open-source culture, technology, and digital citizenship, enabling them to translate major international news into Mandarin.
<br>OCF also sponsored 2 young contributors to attend “Free and Open source Software Developers' European Meeting (FOSDEM)”, a popular international open-source conference. We plant the seeds of open-source influence within the campus by assisting them in bringing insights from abroad back to Taiwan.

<br>We developed a range of courses covering topics such as the fundamentals of open source, digital collaboration for civic engagement, open data, digital rights, and privacy protection. Through engaging explanations and interactive methods—such as the “Open StarTer Village“ board board game—we introduced open-source concepts to government agencies and educational institutions.
<br>Beyond education, we launched practical initiatives to strengthen public resilience against digital threats and risks. By combining hands-on training with openly accessible learning materials, we empowered individuals with the knowledge and tools to navigate the digital landscape securely.

However, proposal submission was not the end of our advocacy. We organized Open Technology Community Meetups to track government progress, bringing together open-source communities and advocates to maintain ongoing attention on these issues.
<br>By participating in government advisory meetings and legislative consultation sessions, we urged policymakers to build the technology application upon robust personal data protection.
<br><h3Build Global Network</h3>In 2024, OCF actively expanded the dialogue between open-source culture, digital rights, and internet governance. We presented our strategies for using open-source solutions to counter digital threats and information monopolies at major international conferences, including the “Digital Rights Asia-Pacific Assembly (DRAPAC)”, the “Asia-Pacific Regional Internet Governance Forum (APrIGF)”, and “Global Gathering”.
<br>We also built a multi-stakeholder dialogue platform, bringing together open-source communities, human rights organizations, businesses, and government representatives to explore inclusive, rights-respecting approaches to internet governance.

In 2024, we worked to extend open culture beyond the traditional open-source community. We believe sustaining an open, transparent, and inclusive digital environment can foster a thriving open-source ecosystem.
<br>To achieve this long-term goal, we implemented different action strategies across five core domains with the most suitable approaches. We select the approaches based on the progress level of each domain in Taiwan.
<br>For open-source code, open government, and open data, which are relatively well-established, we integrated these three themes under ”Open Technology“ to encourage cross-sector dialogue and help embed open collaboration practices into both public and private sectors.

        description: "
<br>In digital rights, a topic still in its early stages in Taiwan, public awareness remains low. To address this, we first mapped the digital threats faced by civil society organizations and examined their defense strategies. Understanding the challenges is the first step toward practical solutions.
<br>In terms of internet freedom, OCF has hosted Internet Freedom Meetups continuously for five years. In 2024, we took a significant step forward by exploring how the principles of openness and digital rights protection, which we have long advocated, can be incorporated into internet governance standards.

These structured learning resources were openly accessible, enabling more people to explore the open-source culture.
<br>Building on our previous success in promoting open source through the ”OpenStarTer Village“ board game, we further incorporated digital rights and open data into educational programs, developing a more comprehensive Open Technology Training Curriculum.

<br>We also invested heavily in nurturing open-source talent. OCF sponsored several young contributors to attend FOSDEM, trained specialized translators in open-source and digital rights, and collaborated with open-source communities to mentor 15 interns, injecting new energy into the ecosystem.

By removing language barriers, we improve the user experience for Taiwanese developers and help more local users access these projects without reinventing the wheel, accelerating Taiwan's technological growth.
<br>Furthermore, we contributed Traditional Chinese translations to upstream projects, ensuring Taiwan's contributions were recognized globally. Our upstream contributions included Standard for Public Code, Bitwarden, Nextcloud, FreeOTP, GIMP, and Mattermost. This initiative increased the visibility of Taiwan's localization expertise. It reinforced the country's role as a key player in the global open-source community.
